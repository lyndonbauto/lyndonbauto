I like working on things in the data space, specifically I am interested in Graph database work.

I am a committer on Apache TinkerPop and most of my work lately has been on this project.

I have worked with C/C++, Java, Python, and Golang. I have also spent a significant amount of time working in embedded systems and manufacturing automation systems.

Most recently I have joined Aerospike and am excited to be dropping some really cool technology with them sometime in the near future.
