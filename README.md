I like working on things in the data space, specifically I am interested in Graph database work.

I am a committer on Apache TinkerPop and most of my work lately has been on this project.

I have worked with C++, Java, Python, and Golang. I have also spent a significant amount of time working in embedded systems and manufacturing automation systems.

Some open source projects i have contributed to are:
- [Apache TinkerPop](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop)
  - [Gremlin-Python remote transaction support](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1515)
  - [Gremlin-Python client transport layer using AIOHTTP](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1416)
  - [Gremlin-Go](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/master/gremlin-go)
- [Apache Arrow Flight](https://github.com/apache/arrow)
